My research focuses on understanding how disaster risks can be reduced using approaches rooted in
social sciences. Particularly, I am interested in understanding how communication influences the
way people think about and respond to disasters and what needs to change. Most of my work is
interdisciplinary, mainly drawing from sociology, psychology and public policy. Check out my [projects
page](https://manomita.netlify.app/phd/) for more information.
